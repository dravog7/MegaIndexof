An indexof of indexof websites

## WHAT IS IT

Indexof websites ( or so I call them) are websites that act generally as a hosting servers for pirated media. They can be found by searching
google in the following format.

- "indexof <tv series/movie/album/song you wanna find>"

These websites list the files and folders like a file system.
To make it easier to locate and stream tv series, I crawled some of these sites and categorized the links obtained to make this website.
